# TODO for BlackJackSRS

1. [ ] Define domain models and interfaces in the Domain project (e.g., `Card`, `Hand`, `Player`, `IRandomProvider`).
2. [ ] Implement application logic and use cases in the Application project (e.g., rounds, rules, outcomes).
3. [ ] Create infrastructure classes in the Infrastructure project (e.g., `IRandomProvider` implementation, external services).
4. [ ] Build core ViewModels in the Presentation project with CommunityToolkit.MVVM.
5. [ ] Create core Views (XAML) and bind them to ViewModels (MVVM).
6. [ ] Write and run unit tests in the Tests project for domain and application logic.
7. [ ] Iterate and expand UI and functionality step by step.
8. [ ] Verify everything by building and testing the full solution.
