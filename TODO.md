# TODO for BlackJackSRS

1. [x] Define domain models and interfaces in the Domain project (e.g., `Card`, `Hand`, `Player`, `IRandomProvider`).
2. [x] Implement application logic and use cases in the Application project (e.g., rounds, rules, outcomes).
3. [x] Create infrastructure classes in the Infrastructure project (e.g., `IRandomProvider` implementation, external services).
4. [x] Build core ViewModels in the Presentation project with CommunityToolkit.MVVM.
5. [x] Create core Views (XAML) and bind them to ViewModels (MVVM).
6. [x] Write and run unit tests in the Tests project for domain and application logic.
7. [x] Iterate and expand UI and functionality step by step.
8. [x] Verify everything by building and testing the full solution.
